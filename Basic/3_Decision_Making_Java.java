/*Code Explanation:
The method compareNM(int n, int m) compares two integers n and m and returns:

"lesser" if n < m
"equal" if n == m
"greater" if n > m
Step-by-step flow:

Input: Two integers n and m.
Comparison:
If n is less than m, return "lesser".
If n is equal to m, return "equal".
If n is greater than m, return "greater".
Output: A string indicating the relation between n and m.
Time Complexity:
Each comparison (n < m, n == m, n > m) takes O(1) time.
The method uses at most 2 comparisons in the worst case.
ðŸ”¸ Total Time Complexity: O(1) (constant time)

Space Complexity:
No extra space is used apart from a few variables and the returned string.
String literals like "lesser", "equal", and "greater" are constants.
ðŸ”¸ Total Space Complexity: O(1) (constant space)

âœ… Final Verdict:
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)s
