/* question - Given an array arr[] of positive integers. The task is to return the count of the number of odd and even elements in the array.

Note: Return two elements where the first one in the count of odd & second one is the count of even. */

/*âœ… Explanation of the Code:
The method countOddEven(int[] arr) counts the number of odd and even integers in an array.

Step-by-Step Breakdown:
Input: An integer array arr.

Initialize Counters:

countEven = 0 â€” to count even numbers.
countOdd = 0 â€” to count odd numbers.
Iterate Over the Array:

Loop through each element arr[i]:
If arr[i] % 2 == 0, increment countEven.
Else, increment countOdd.
Return Result:

Returns an integer array: new int[]{countOdd, countEven}.
Index 0 holds the count of odd numbers.
Index 1 holds the count of even numbers.
Example:
For input arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}:

Odd numbers: 1, 3, 5 â†’ countOdd = 3
Even numbers: 2, 4 â†’ countEven = 2
Output: [3, 2]

Time Complexity:
The method loops through the array once.
For an array of size n, the loop runs n times.
ðŸ”¸ Total Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity:
Uses only two integer counters (countOdd, countEven) and a result array of size 2.
ðŸ”¸ Total Space Complexity: O(1) (since the extra space doesnâ€™t grow with input size)
